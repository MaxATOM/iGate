# iGate
iGate is a full gate system at home. It lets you to enter and leave your home without caring a remote control, regardless going to see who is ringing at the entrance, and even knowing when and who to open the gate.

When you arrive home, by approaching by car to the entrance of your home, the gate detects your smartphone and opens automatically, only for you.
Once installed on your couch, watch what is happening around your home with outdoor surveillance, or check who open the gate during the day.

Preview
-----------------
The system is distributed across multiple platforms: a tablet application, smartphone application, a website and an opening manager, located near the gate.

Development
---------------
Simulation and hardware available forced us to use a motor that simulates the operation of a sliding gate, but the overall operation is exactly the same. Programming is the most important part of the project, it makes live the heart of the system.
We find in several places of the system : in the smartphone and tablet applications in the Raspberry Pi server program and the E-Block.
To recap, I realized applications for the iPhone and iPad and the server Raspberry Pi For the remainder of this file program, we look at the iPhone application and the server program.
Below is a diagram showing the relationship between programming and gate.

Amount of the project
---------------

iGate at a reasonable cost, although there have no gate itself. The cost of smartphone or tablet is not accounted for, itâ€™s assumed that you are already in possession of both.
The total price is $240 allocated as follows :
* 1 complete Raspberry Pi : $80
* 1 E-Block set : $130
* 1 servomotor : $30

Thanks
---------------

I extend my thanks to Mr. S. Siot Taillefer and Mr. JL. Tayan for all help provided during this 28 sessions.
